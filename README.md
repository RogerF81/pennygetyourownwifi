This module replaces the /system/etc/wifi/WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini file with the stock Pixel 2XL Oreo file.
Wifi is supposed to be more stable thanks to that.

Confirmed fully working on HTC 10 and the OnePlus 5 without any issues.

master branch contains the stock Pixel 2 XL file. custom branch contains a modified version.
